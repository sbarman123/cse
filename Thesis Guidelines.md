1.1.	Body of the Synopsis
The author is responsible for the way the text is organized.  However, it should have title of all sections (e.g. Introduction, Review of Literature, Objectives and Scope, Results, Discussion of result, Conclusion, Contributions made by the scholar, and References) in capital letters and center justified.  The text (in each section) begins after a triple space.
If the synopsis contains text that is a reprint of a previously published report, a credit line “Reprinted with permission from” followed by source must be placed on the page. Appendix need not be given in the synopsis.
Use MS Word Times New Roman/Arial (or LaTeX) with font size 12 and 1.5 line spacing for the text.

1.2	References
Use number reference citation system where numbers in the text are in superscript only.  If several references are cited at once, then numbers are separated by comma.  If reference number is to be mentioned at the end of a sentence, then the superscript number is placed outside the punctuation marks.
The reference list is compiled (under reference section) in numerical order.  No spacing between lines within a particular entry is present.  However, a double space separates two references.
Please note that the same format must be followed while preparing synopsis and thesis manuscripts.

1.3.	Tables and Figures
When data are compiled in rows and columns, these are referred to as a “Table”.  Tables should be used only when absolutely necessary. Figures include the diagrams, schemes (including chemical reactions), photos, maps, plots or other schematic/graphical representation.
The guideline for ordering, placement, numbering and assigning title (for tables) or caption (for figures) is same as that mentioned in the same as that for thesis. For reference, please consult the “Guidelines on the Preparation of a Thesis”.

1.3.1	Order of Tables and Figures
Tables and figures also must be referenced in order (i.e., Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, not Table 1, Table 3, Table 2). It is not acceptable to refer to Table 3 in the text before referring to Table 2. However, once a table has been referred to in the main text, it can be mentioned again out of its sequential order. Each figure or table appears only once and cannot be repeated.

1.4	Table and Figure Placement
A large table or figure is placed by itself on the page, centered within the thesis margins. Although it is not necessary for large tables or figures to be centered precisely between the top and bottom margins of the page, tables and figures should be placed so that they look balanced on the page. Full-page tables or figures must be placed on the page immediately following the textual reference. Other guidelines pertaining to placement of tables and figures are same as that mentioned for writing the thesis manuscript (c.f. pg ---)

1.5.	Page Numbering
The title page should not have a number printed on it. The page next to the title page should bear the page number 1. Page numbers should be printed centered at the bottom of each page.

1.6  Continuity of Ideas
It is very important that there is a continuity of idea in your synopsis/ manuscript. Few suggestions in this regard are mentioned below:
A particular paragraph should elaborate only one theme/idea. If there is a need to emphasize multiple themes, then it is suggested to name them in a single paragraph and subsequently discuss them in separate paragraphs.
There should be a smooth transition from one paragraph to the next paragraph. In order to do so, the first paragraph mentions the theme of the next paragraph. 

1.7 Mathematical Symbols
Mathematical expressions must italicize all symbols used in them. A distinct look (to the mathematical expression) may be imparted by separating them from the text (both preceding and following it) by larger line spacing and an indentation should be given. Each equation must appear only after it has been referenced in the text.
